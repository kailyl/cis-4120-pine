# Pine

In this project, we developed a personalized news app that aggregates a daily news feed for users to engage with diverse journalism. 

## Main Features

**Bookmark:** After users have saved articles, they can view them in the bookmarked page. This page also includes features for users to sort articles by topic, title, dates, and more. 

**Explore:** In addition to this personalized news feed, we also want to make sure that Pine can be the go-to platform for reading all journalism. Our explore page displays the top 5 trending searches, as well as 5 of the most popular articles on our app. 
This page also has a search feature, allowing users to search for any topic they are interested in. 

**Customize:** In addition to tracking the clicks and saves a user makes, our customization page allows users to select the type of content they want to see. We also understand that people may be uncomfortable with some media outlets and ideas, so Pine also allows readers to hide specific sources or topics from their daily feed.
